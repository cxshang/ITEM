ITEM
====

An overlapping community detecting algorithm using information theory and expectation and maximization process

1. Denpending softwares  
In my experiments, ITEM running Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.3 (Tikanga),  
python2.7.5  
numpy1.7.1   
cython0.19.1  
cityhash, which codes can be found at https://code.google.com/p/cityhash  
igraph0.6.5 and python-igraph 0.6.5  
openmp  
C++ STL  
ITEM also uses the log function in fmath.hpp, which can be found at https://github.com/herumi/fmath ,  
you should download fmath.hpp and save it in this directory.  
 
Above softwares (may be higher versions) must be install before running ITEM.  
 
If you want use the google's sparsehash to replace corresponding ones of C++ STL,   
then sparesehash must be installed, which can be found at https://code.google.com/p/sparsehash/ ,  
and must modify the code at 50th line of docitem.pyx from  
DEF USEING_SPARSE_MAPANDSET = False  
to  
DEF USEING_SPARSE_MAPANDSET = True  
meanwhile, please modify the code at 3th line of stdalgorithm.pxd from  
DEF USEING_SPARSE_MAPANDSET = False  
to  
DEF USEING_SPARSE_MAPANDSET = True  
 
2. Compile and link   
To compile and link, please first modify setup.py an compile.sh to make the linking and including options  
correct according your software configures.  Then run ./compile on console.  

3. Run item  
For the usages of item, just type ./item on console to see help.
